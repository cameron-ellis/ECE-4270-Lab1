To prepare working:
git pull
--This updates YOUR directory with the most current version.

To update the repository with your changes:

git status
--This shows you what you've changed.

git add [filename]
--This will add what you want to push.

git commit
--will pull up a text editor (prob nano) and lets you type your change comments. Save the file to prepare the commit.

git push
--This finally pushes your changes to the repository. Put in your github username and the token you generated. NOT your actual password.
